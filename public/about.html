        <h2>The inspiration of Akasha Terminal</h2>
        <p>
          The name and concept of Akasha Terminal got the inspiration from Akasha System from the video game Genshin
          impact. <br>In game the Akasha System allows for the transfer and sharing of information via a device called
          the
          Akasha Terminal
          Every information that every existed is stored within an Irminsul tree which is where the logo of this website
          comes from
          <br><br>
          The Akasha System may draw inspiration from the Akashic records, a collection of "memories" of every thought,
          feeling and event since the beginning of time. The records are imprinted on the akasha (aether), and are said
          to
          be accessible to select individuals.
